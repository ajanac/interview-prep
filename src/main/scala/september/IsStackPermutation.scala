 *          Problem
 *          *******
 *          Stack Permutations
            You are given two arrays A and B of unique elements of size N.
            Check if one array is a stack permutation of the other array or not.
            Stack permutation means that one array can be created from another array using a stack and stack operations.
            Example 1:
            *********
            Input:
            N = 3
            A = {1,2,3}
            B = {2,1,3}
            Output:
            1
            Explanation:
            1. push 1 from A to stack
            2. push 2 from A to stack
            3. pop 2 from stack to B
            4. pop 1 from stack to B
            5. push 3 from A to stack
            6. pop 3 from stack to B
            *************
            Example 2:
            *************
            Input:
            N = 3
            A = {1,2,3}
            B = {3,1,2}
            Output:
            0
            Explanation:
            Not Possible
            Your Task:
            You don't need to read input or print anything.
            Your task is to complete the function isStackPermutation()
            which takes two arrays A and B as inputs and returns 1 if it is a stack permutation otherwise returns 0.
            *****************************
            Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
            Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
            ******************************
            Constraints:
            1 <= N <= 105
            0 <= A[i], B[i] <= 2*105
            Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceeds 106
            ********
            Approach
            ********
 *          The idea to start iterating on the input array and storing its element one by one in a stack and
 *          if the top of our stack matches with an element in the output array we will pop that element from
 *          the stack and compare the next element of the output array with the top of our stack if again it
 *          matches then again pop until our stack isnâ€™t empty
